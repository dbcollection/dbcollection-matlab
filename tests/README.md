# Tests

This folder contains unit tests for the dbcollection wrapper code.

The unit tests were written using the [MOxUnit](https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit) framework for Matlab/Octave. To run all tests simply do:

```matlab
moxunit_runtests('/path/to/dbcollection/APIs/matlab/tests')
```

or if you are in the `tests/` dir:

```matlab
moxunit_runtests
```
